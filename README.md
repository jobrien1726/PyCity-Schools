# PyCity Schools

## Project Overview

This project uses Python Pandas to analyze district-wide standarized test results to showcase trends in school performance.

First the analysis is done at the district level and summarizes: 
- Total Schools
- Total Students
- Total Budget
- Average Math Score
- Average Reading Score
- % Passing Math
- % Passing Reading
- Overall Passing Rate (Average of the above two) 

Then the same analysis is done at the school level, and the 5 lowest performing schools are highligthed.

Math and Reading test scores are then analyzed by grade (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school. Finally, the test scores are analyzed as a function of spending, school size, and type of school.
